# YAMGL (Yet Another Minecraft Gui Library) 
### A mod library to make it easier to create you own custom GUI written in pure Kotlin. DSL is available! 

### Big thanks to [Elementa](https://github.com/EssentialGG/Elementa) and [JustACore](https://github.com/JustAGod1/JustACore) for inspiration and ideas. Special thanks to [GExt](https://github.com/StannisMod/gext) for idea of multi-module project with target-independent core

## Why? 
Abovementioned libraries are good but in every of them I found some lacks - Java's Builder pattern is not very suitable 
for building UI, Elementa is missing 1.7.10 support and sometimes I didn't meet ability to create some basic primitives like
triangle or rectangle by them
